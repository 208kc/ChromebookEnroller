# ChromebookEnrollment
Uses Teensy-LC and button, LED to enroll chromebooks. 

This arduino code will enroll a chromebook into the domain you indicate in the script (note you must change the enrollement user and password before this script will work for you). 

A LED is lit green when ready to enroll. Plug the teensy in press the button and the LED turns red to indicate the enrollement steps are taking place. When ready for the next device the light will turn green again.
